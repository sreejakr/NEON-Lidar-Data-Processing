# üå≤ NEON LiDAR Forest Monitoring with R

This repository analyzes multi-temporal **Canopy Height Model (CHM)** data from the **National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON)** to detect forest structural changes over time at the **Bartlett Experimental Forest (BART)** site.

We use **processed CHM raster tiles** from 2019 and 2022 to assess **tree height change**, **canopy cover**, and **forest disturbance or recovery**.

##  What is LiDAR?

**LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging)** is a remote sensing technique that uses laser pulses to generate 3D information about the Earth's surface.

NEON collects LiDAR data via aircraft and processes it into several products:
- **Point cloud (.LAZ)** ‚Äì raw 3D laser returns
- **DTM (Digital Terrain Model)** ‚Äì ground elevation
- **DSM (Digital Surface Model)** ‚Äì top-of-everything elevation
- **CHM (Canopy Height Model)** ‚Äì vegetation height above ground

##  Dataset Description

- **Dataset**: Ecosystem Structure ‚Äì Canopy Height Model (CHM)  
- **Product ID**: `DP3.30015.001`  
- **Format**: Raster GeoTIFF (.tif)  
- **Resolution**: 1-meter  
- **Tile Size**: 1 km √ó 1 km  
- **Years Used**: 2019 and 2022  
- **Site**: BART (Bartlett Experimental Forest)  
- **Source**: [NEON Data Portal](https://data.neonscience.org)

> üîÅ Each CHM pixel represents **tree height (in meters)** above bare earth, calculated as:
>
> ```text
> CHM = DSM - DTM
> ```
> 
>** What are the CHM tiles?**
Each .tif file (like NEON_D01_BART_DP3_312000_4873000_CHM.tif) is a 1 km √ó 1 km raster tile of the Canopy Height Model for that location.
NEON's AOP (Airborne Observation Platform) flies over a site and collects data tile by tile.
Each tile has:
 - Spatial extent (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)
 - 1-meter resolution (i.e., 1000x1000 pixels)
 - Tree height values at each pixel
 - A coordinate reference system (UTM, usually)

## üéØ Project Objectives

1. **Visualize Canopy Height Models** for 2019 and 2022
2. **Estimate Canopy Cover** (% of area with vegetation taller than threshold)
3. **Detect Forest Change** over time (growth or loss)
4. **Visualize Spatial Patterns** of canopy change
5. **Quantify Areas** with significant forest recovery or disturbance

## Canopy Cover Analysis
- **Canopy Cover in 2019:** 67.61%  
- **Canopy Cover in 2022:** 74.48%  

**Interpretation:**
- If Canopy Cover > 70%, it is classified as dense forest.  
- If Canopy Cover < 40%, it is classified as a fragmented forest or open woodland.

# Project 1: Multi-Year Forest Change Detection (Before & After Analysis)
This analysis compares CHM data from different years to detect forest growth and loss.

## Steps:
1. Download CHM dataset for multiple years (e.g., 2019 & 2022).  
2. Load both CHM datasets into R.  
3. Compute forest height changes.  
4. Visualize and analyze forest gain & loss.

## Forest Height Change (2019-2022)
Key Observations:
- **Mostly Yellow Areas** ‚Üí Little to no change in tree height  
- **Green Areas** ‚Üí Decrease in height (deforestation, storm damage, logging)  
- **Pink/Brown Areas** ‚Üí Increase in height (regrowth, new tree growth)

## Overall Change Statistics
- **Average Canopy Height Change:** 1.08 m  
- **Maximum Height Increase:** 41.95 m  
- **Maximum Height Decrease:** -43.71 m  
- **Canopy Cover in 2019:** 67.61%  
- **Canopy Cover in 2022:** 74.48%  
- **Forest Growth Area:** 2.8%  
- **Forest Loss Area:** 0.73%


## Forest Gain vs. Loss
- **Green (-30m to -10m):** Canopy height decrease (deforestation, storm damage, human activity)  
- **Yellow (~0m):** No significant change in forest height  
- **Brown/Beige (10m to 30m):** Tree growth

This visualization highlights areas with significant changes in canopy height between 2019 and 2022.


- The majority of the area remains yellow (~0m change), indicating stable canopy height.
- Scattered green patches show tree height reductions (possible deforestation).
- Scattered brown areas indicate tree height increases (regrowth or afforestation).
- Sharp dips in the waveform align with deforested patches.
- Peaks in the graph correspond to regions of high variation in forest height.
