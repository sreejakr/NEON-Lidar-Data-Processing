# NEON-Lidar-Data-Processing using R

LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging)
	‚Ä¢	Remote sensing technology that uses laser pulses to measure distances.
	‚Ä¢	Outputs a 3D ‚Äúpoint cloud‚Äù of the environment (trees, buildings, ground).
	‚Ä¢	Data is stored in .laz (compressed) or .las (uncompressed) files.

üîπ Each LiDAR point contains:

In this dataset, the LiDAR data is unclassified (Classification = 0 for all points).
Without classification, we cannot distinguish between ground, vegetation, and buildings.

Goal:

Assign each LiDAR point to a category:

Why Does This Matter?
	‚Ä¢	Ground points (2) ‚Üí Needed for Digital Terrain Model (DTM).
	‚Ä¢	Canopy points (5) ‚Üí Needed for Canopy Height Model (CHM).
	‚Ä¢	Building points (6) ‚Üí Helps separate man-made structures.
	‚Ä¢	Water points (9) ‚Üí Helps in hydrological studies.

Dark Green (Low Values) ‚Üí Short vegetation or bare ground.
	‚Ä¢	Yellow to Light Green ‚Üí Medium-height trees.
	‚Ä¢	Brown/Pinkish Areas (High Values) ‚Üí Tall trees (30m+).

 Canopy Cover Percentage: 36.68 % (	If Canopy Cover > 70%, it‚Äôs a dense forest. < 40%, it‚Äôs a fragmented forest or open woodland)
