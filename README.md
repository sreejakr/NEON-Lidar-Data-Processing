# NEON-Lidar-Data-Processing using R

LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging)
	‚Ä¢	Remote sensing technology that uses laser pulses to measure distances.
	‚Ä¢	Outputs a 3D ‚Äúpoint cloud‚Äù of the environment (trees, buildings, ground).
	‚Ä¢	Data is stored in .laz (compressed) or .las (uncompressed) files.

üîπ Each LiDAR point contains:

In this dataset, the LiDAR data is unclassified (Classification = 0 for all points).
Without classification, we cannot distinguish between ground, vegetation, and buildings.

Goal:

Assign each LiDAR point to a category:

Why Does This Matter?
	‚Ä¢	Ground points (2) ‚Üí Needed for Digital Terrain Model (DTM).
	‚Ä¢	Canopy points (5) ‚Üí Needed for Canopy Height Model (CHM).
	‚Ä¢	Building points (6) ‚Üí Helps separate man-made structures.
	‚Ä¢	Water points (9) ‚Üí Helps in hydrological studies.

Dark Green (Low Values) ‚Üí Short vegetation or bare ground.
	‚Ä¢	Yellow to Light Green ‚Üí Medium-height trees.
	‚Ä¢	Brown/Pinkish Areas (High Values) ‚Üí Tall trees (30m+).

 Canopy Cover Percentage: 36.68 % (	If Canopy Cover > 70%, it‚Äôs a dense forest. < 40%, it‚Äôs a fragmented forest or open woodland)

 # Project 1: Multi-Year Forest Change Detection (Before & After Analysis)
 
1Ô∏è) Download a second CHM dataset for comparison (e.g., 2022 or 2024).
2) Load both CHM datasets into R.
3) Compute forest height changes between the two years.
4) Visualize and analyze forest gain & loss.

From the Forest Height Change (2019-2022) Map, we observe:
‚úÖ Mostly Yellow Areas ‚Üí Little to no change in tree height.
‚úÖ Green Areas ‚Üí Tree height has decreased (deforestation, storm damage, logging).
‚úÖ Pink/Brown Areas ‚Üí Possible height increase (regrowth, new tree growth).

"Canopy Cover in 2019: 67.61 %"
"Canopy Cover in 2022: 74.48 %"


**Area of Forest Growth vs. Loss**
1) "Forest Growth Area: 2.8 %"
2) "Forest Loss Area: 0.73 %"

This visualization highlights areas with significant changes in canopy height between 2019 and 2022.

Green (-30 to -10 meters) ‚Üí Large canopy height decrease (tree loss due to deforestation, storm damage, or human activity).
Yellow (~0 meters) ‚Üí No significant change in forest height.
Brown/Beige (10 to 30 meters) ‚Üí Tree growth 

- The majority of the area remains yellow (~0m change), indicating stable canopy height.
- Scattered green patches show tree height reductions (possible deforestation).
- Scattered brown areas indicate tree height increases (regrowth or afforestation).
- Sharp dips in the waveform align with deforested patches.
- Peaks in the graph correspond to regions of high variation in forest height.
